# Click-Saver

A simple interface to visually demonstrate savings accrued over time with an animation of the Earth spinning and start/stop functionality. 
The user can input how much they want to save and run the simulation and will update the amount as time passes. Also displays information giving a breakdown of the days, weeks, months and years that have passed as the simulation runs.
